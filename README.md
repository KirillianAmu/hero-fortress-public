# Hero Fortress, a custom Team Fortress 2 Gamemode. (Public Version)

Hero Fortress is based on lots of various team based (hero) shooters.

It currently features:

-Each class with their own unique Ultimate abilities, charge it up and unleash the hell upon your enemies.

-A custom item shop, which could count as perks. There are currently 18 items, all of which work on each class. You can hold 3 of them at a time, so go ahead and experiment with various combinations!

BIG Maps are reccomended for this gamemode. While it can run on smaller maps, it gets cramped real quick on big player count. (More than 16 players)

This is a public fork. Some features may or may not be outdated.
